# PIZZA-SALES-ANALYSIS-PROJECT-USING-SQL
The Pizza Sales Analysis project involves analyzing sales data for a pizza restaurant using SQL. The goal is to extract key insights from sales data, such as revenue trends, popular pizzas, and customer ordering patterns. This project is useful for developing data analytics and SQL querying skills.

 Dataset Description
 we have 4 tables 
The dataset typically contains multiple tables, including:

1.Orders Table

-order_id (INT, Primary Key)

-date (DATETIME)

t-ime (timme )


2.Order Details Table

-order_details_id	

-order_id

-pizza_id	

-quantity

3.Pizzas Table

-pizza_id

-pizza_type_id	

-size	

-price

4.pizza type 

-pizza_type_id

-name	

-category

-ingredients

Key Business Questions

Using SQL, we can answer important business questions like:

Basic:

1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.

4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.

5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.


Intermediate:

1. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.

2. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.

3. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.

4. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.

5. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.


Advanced:

1. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.

2. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.

3. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
